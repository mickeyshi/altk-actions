    """The informativity of a language is identified with the successful communication between a speaker and a listener.

    This function is a wrapper for `communicative_success`.

    Args:
        language: the language to compute informativity of.

        prior: a probability distribution representing communicative need (frequency) for Referents.

        utility: a function representing the usefulness of listener guesses about speaker Referents, e.g. Referent similarity. To reward only exact recovery of meanings, use the indicator function (default).

        kind: {"literal, pragmatic"} Whether to measure informativity using literal or pragmatic agents, as canonically described in the Rational Speech Act framework. The default is "literal".

    *Concepts*:
        The speaker can be thought of as a conditional distribution over expressions given meanings. The listener is likewise a conditional distribution over meanings given expressions. The communicative need, or cognitive source, is a prior probability over meanings representing how frequently agents need to use certain meanings in communication. The utility function represents the similarity, or appropriateness, of the listener's guess m' about the speaker's intended meaning m.

    *Formula*:
        The informativity of a language $L$ with meaning space $M$ is defined:

    $I(L) := \sum_{m \in M} p(m) \sum_{i \in L} p(i|m) \sum_{\hat{m} \in i} p(\hat{m}|i) \cdot u(m, \hat{m})$

    *Bounds*:
        A perfectly informative (=1.0) language can be constructed with a exactly one expression for each meaning.

        For u() = indicator(), every language has nonzero informativity because a language must contain at least one expression, and an expression must contain at least one meaning.
